# Number-Guess-Game

## General
This is a number guessing game whereby the Player will be prompted to predict a randomly generated number between the given range. At a correct guess, the game will award the player a point and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on.
The player will start the game with 3 lives whereby there will be a deduction of a live per wrong guess and the game will automatically end when the Player makes a wrong guess when on live 0.
